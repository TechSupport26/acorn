blocker: Connoropolous-patch-2  connoropolous-hc-redux-middleware @holochain/client

decide on a strategy ^^

fix the redux dependency (?) short term fix? (10 minute)

client side Acorn zome library/module (2 hrs)



question: how many components under `components` folder use redux? 19 (*.component) (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)



Wesley
1. backend name changes, 
2. typescript types for backend data types (Rust) (Outcome, Connection, OutcomeComment, OutcomeEntryPoint, etc.)



Pegah 
1. implenment scss - done
2. develop a clear understanding of how css variables will be used (and document if we can)
3. convert all css files to scss - done

css notes: 
- lots of duplications due to vanilla css and lack of nesting
- lots of overriding happening for some components using generic compenent templates
- need to switch to rem instead of pixel, as the screen resolution impacts its
- inconcistency between using _ (olrder class names) and - (newer claass names)
- colors dont have names so its difficult to assign a recurring color to a class name
- screen size related classes (and beak pints) are inefficient
- need to get rid of commented out lines

"According to the guideline, here are some common properties that will benefit from variables:

    border-radius
    color
    font-family
    font-weight
    margin (gutters, grid gutters)
    transition (duration, easing) â€“ consider a mixin*
